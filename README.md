# ResolveMetaGeta
 Python 3 script for importing scriptE or Focus Pulling Units Metadata
 

 
 Currently only works on 16.2 but originally conceived on 17b1 so once that is out of beta I will add support.
 
 Tested on windows only at this point. Mac users please leave any issues and I can get it going there.
 
 Requires the following python modules:
 Timecode
 Pandas
 
 Install to any folder within the following:
